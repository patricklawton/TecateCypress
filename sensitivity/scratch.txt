            <metric> no change value
            mu_tauc
                sigm_tauc
                    <metric> data cube over (C, ncell, tau_i)

We don't need delta_tau_i for reference to phase data anymore, so maybe just remove creation of delta_tau_vec from init and add attribute for a given uncertainty value under product uncertainty loop in phase.py
Or maybe make a separate method for setting tau uncertainty, called before process_samples, within which the attributes are set. 
In here or separate method, could also pre_generate tauc uncertainties? Might be too much to carry in memory at once, could generate per (C,ncell) combo just before calling process_samples (especially when diong tau scaling cases, but also might be fine on memory)
